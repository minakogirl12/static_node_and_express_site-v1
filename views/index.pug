        | Greetings! Here you will find a collection of projects to showcase my ablities with various technologies and programming languages. This site itself is a project to highlight skills using Express, Pug, and Javascript. It is my hope that this portfolio will not only show my programming ablities but also, be a testament to my diligence and creativity.
